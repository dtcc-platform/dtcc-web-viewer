# DTCC Viewer

The DTCC Viewer is currenty part of a project running between 2022-2024 called "Digital Twin City Viewer".

This means that the _develop_ branch is not used in this repo at the moment, instead use: [github.com/paramountric/digitaltwincityviewer](https://github.com/paramountric/digitaltwincityviewer) for issues, bug fixes, discussions, feature requests, pull requests, etc.

## About project viewers

The Digital Twin City Viewer will have several viewers connected to different projects (potentially not strictly related to DTCC), using the same underlying viewer component. The project folder is used to separate viewers with different _viewer layers_ and _GUI_ needed for the different projects.

At the moment the projects/citymodel-file-viewer is the one used at [view.dtcc.chalmers.se](https://view.dtcc.chalmers.se/). This might change in the future, as more features will be developed and can be added to the projects.

## Status

The DTCC Web Viewer is in the early stage of the project implemented as a file viewer for CityModel files. Refer to the project citymodel-file-viewer.

The Digital Twin City Viewer is expected to be released in a first stable version in the end of 2022.

## Releases and viewer versions

Relevant releases will be merged from the original repository as needed and automatically published on [view.dtcc.chalmers.se](https://view.dtcc.chalmers.se/).

Please refer to the version as displayed in the viewer header. This can be compared with the git tag.
