# Layer concept

This viewer uses the same concept of `layers` as Deck.gl, created by Uber.

Some of the layers used here are modified versions of existing layers at https://deck.gl provided by Uber with the MIT License.

All source code files should have the appropriate attribution if they are derived from Deck.gl layer compatible open source projects.
