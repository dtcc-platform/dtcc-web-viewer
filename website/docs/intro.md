# Intro

Welcome! The Digital Twin City Viewer is developed using _Continuous Delivery_ from start, which means it's already released at current state even if the project does not provide the desired features or documentation yet.

The first stable release is planned at the end of 2022, and the documentation should be updated as needed from feedback of any people that engage and want to use this project. So very welcome to engage!

Head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/paramountric/digitaltwincityviewer/issues) and create a new issue :)
